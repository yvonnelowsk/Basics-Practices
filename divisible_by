Write a function which takes two arguments and returns all number, which are divisible by given divisor. First argument is array of numbers
and the second is divisor.

Example

divisible_by([1,2,3,4,5,6], 2) == [2,4,6]


Solution:

def divisible_by(numbers, divisor):
    return [x for x in numbers if x%divisor == 0]
